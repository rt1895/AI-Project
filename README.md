This is a project to develop a agent for playing Baroque Chess, which is basically Chess with much complex rules (general rules can be seen on Wikipedia). The main code for the bot is in terminator_BC_Player.py, which uses the minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for finding the most optimal move given a board state.

BaroqueGameMaster.py is used to conducted a game between two players.
